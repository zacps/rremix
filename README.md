# Rust Remix Compiler

A Rust compiler for the Remix programming language.

## Current State

The current state of the compiler is described below.

### Parser

rremix uses a parsing expression grammar parser generated by [pest](pest.rs). The parser implements all lexing (including significant whitespace) so there is no separate lexer step.

Currently the parser can parse all of remix sans objects (`create`), but does have edge cases where it will eroneously reject valid programs.

### Schematic Analysis

The parse tree is converted into an intermediate representation which is responsible for resolving functions, variables, and reducing some syntactic sugar. This is also where function call/variable name ambiguities are resolved.

### Codegen

The original plan was to generate LLVM IR in a similar manner to the rust compiler, rustc. However, to save time the decision was made to switch to generating C instead. Codegen is in a very early state. Variables, literals, function calls are supported but anonymous blocks and control flow structures are not yet supported.

### Errors

Error messages relating to experimental function resolution have been implemented, and produce nice suggestions supported by [codespan-reporting](https://lib.rs/crates/codespan-reporting).

Other error messages produce panics.

### Testing

rremix is tested primarily using a number of snapshot tests at various stages of the compiler.

These are derived from existing tests and examples in the Red remix interpreter.

Tests can be run with

```
$ cargo test
```
